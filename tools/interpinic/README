Running gnumake in this directory will create an executable named

   "interpinic"  

Its function is to map an input clm initial file to an output clm initial file,
where the output clm initial file is overwritten with the interpolated values.

The code is written with global grids in mind. It has not been tested for
regional grids and may require code modification to work.

USAGE:

interpinic -i <input initial data file>  -o <output initial data file>
